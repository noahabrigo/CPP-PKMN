# pokemon-go
A command-line version of Pokemon GO programmed in C++. Simple as that. A project in Fall 2019 for school.
You will find two versions of this project. One that uses a timer and automatically runs a simulated
pokemon battle, and the other that requires your input. The first version is not working fully, while
the second version works a little better. This was a beginner project for school.
